### Hide/show CSS elements with a shortcut

This extension allows you to hide/show elements of your choosing on specific
pages with a shortcut (Ctrl+Shift+Y by default). The shortcut can toggle different elements depending on the specific 
domain or page you're on, and you can specify which elements are toggled by
adding their CSS class name (which you can check by right clicking on the 
element and clicking Inspect Element). 

I originally made this extension to hide the GUI in youtube, which was helpful for
screenshots since the GUI always shows while a video is paused. An example is below. 
But it was a quick change to make it generalize to any number of elements specified
by CSS class, conditional on which page you're on.
